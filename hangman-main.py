import sys
# VS Code will ask which Python you would like to use when 'import sys'
# is added to the python file.

print(sys.path)
# This will print out the import paths or where Python will look when
# we try to import things. i.g. If we wanted to import the Request Libray
# then Python will look for the Request Libray inside 'sys.path'
